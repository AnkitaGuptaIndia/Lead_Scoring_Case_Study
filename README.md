# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study

## Problem Statement
X Education Company is an education company which sells Online Courses to professionals. Marketing of the company is done via several websites and search engines. When people land on the website and fill up a form for enquiry, they are classified as lead. Sales Team approach to these leads for sale of their product (conversion).

Current Lead Conversion Rate of the company is 30% and company intends to increase the Conversion rate to 80% by identifying “Hot Leads” which has comparatively high probability for conversion.

Now there is 1 dataset provided, which contains details of around 9000+ leads on 37 features.

We have following Goals as a Data Analyst - 
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. 

## Dataset details
A dataset is provided with 9240 row entries and 37 features to identify the conversion.

There are various features involved like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted.
